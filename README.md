# A Bookkeeping App
codes of personal project in CS210

## General Information

We spent money almost every day, but do we spent them in the way we expected? To give a satisfying answer to this
problem, I developed this project to help people in ***tracking their expenses*** and 
***having a good view of their habit in spending money***. **Anyone** who has a strong will
to acquire a **good habit in spending money** is welcomed to try out this app. I choose this 
as my term project because recently I'm saving money to buy something that is *a little-bit of* expensive. 
I need an app like this to help me find out where can I reduce my expense and save more money.
