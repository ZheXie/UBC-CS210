# A Bookkeeping App

## General Information

We spent money almost every day, but do we spent them in the way we expected? To give a satisfying answer to this
problem, I developed this project to help people in ***tracking their expenses*** and 
***having a good view of their habit in spending money***. **Anyone** who has a strong will
to acquire a **good habit in spending money** is welcomed to try out this app. I choose this 
as my term project because recently I'm saving money to buy something that is *a little-bit of* expensive. 
I need an app like this to help me find out where can I reduce my expense and save more money.

## User stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add a new item to the expense history.
- As a user, I want to be able to calculate the net income of each month.
- As a user, I want to be able to sort the expense histories in the type of item they are spent on.
- As a user, I want to be able to set an upper limit of my monthly expense and receive a reminder when my expense 
approaches this limit.
- As a user, I want to be able to get a report of my monthly expense with the percentage of money I spent on 
different types of items. 
- As a user, I want to be able to save my expense history to file.
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to load my expense history from file.

## Phase 4: Task 2

In this phase, I redesigned the History class to make it robust.

## Phase 4: Task 3
If I had more time, I would change the aggregation between Item class and ExpenseDate class to a bi-directional 
association. This change will make it easier when we want to find all expenses and/or incomes in a certain time period.
